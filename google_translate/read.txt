Hong Kong (CNN)The number of novel coronavirus cases has risen to more than 64,000 worldwide, after China reported another major increase at the epicenter of the outbreak following a change in how authorities there diagnose cases.

As of Friday morning, over 100 more people had died of the virus, officially known as Covid-19, in central China's Hubei province -- raising the global death toll to 1,383. Of those, all but three have died in mainland China.
Chinese health authorities also confirmed an additional 5,090 cases across the country. That's a major spike, but nowhere near the 14,840 new cases reported Thursday -- the largest single-day rise since the epidemic began.
